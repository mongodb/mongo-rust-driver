Server Selection Tests
======================

This directory contains platform-independent tests that drivers can use
to prove their conformance to the Server Selection spec. The tests
are provided in both YAML and JSON formats, and drivers may test against
whichever format is more convenient for them.

Version
-------

Files in the "specifications" repository have no version scheme. They are not
tied to a MongoDB server version.

Test Format and Use
-------------------

There are two types of tests for the server selection spec, tests for
round trip time (RTT) calculation, and tests for server selection logic.

Drivers should be able to test their server selection logic
without any network I/O, by parsing topology descriptions and read preference
documents from the test files and passing them into driver code. Parts of the
server selection code may need to be mocked or subclassed to achieve this.

RTT Calculation Tests
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

These YAML files contain the following keys:

- ``avg_rtt_ms``: a server's previous average RTT, in milliseconds
- ``new_rtt_ms``: a new RTT value for this server, in milliseconds
- ``new_avg_rtt``: this server's newly-calculated average RTT, in milliseconds

For each file, create a server description object initialized with ``avg_rtt_ms``.
Parse ``new_rtt_ms``, and ensure that the new RTT value for the mocked server
description is equal to ``new_avg_rtt``.

If driver architecture doesn't easily allow construction of server description
objects in isolation, unit testing the EWMA algorithm using these inputs
and expected outputs is acceptable.

Server Selection Logic Tests
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

These YAML files contain the following setup for each test:

- ``topology_description``: the state of a mocked cluster
- ``operation``: the kind of operation to perform, either read or write
- ``read_preference``: a read preference document

For each file, create a new TopologyDescription object initialized with the values
from ``topology_description``. Create a ReadPreference object initialized with the
values from ``read_preference``.

Together with "operation", pass the newly-created TopologyDescription and ReadPreference
to server selection, and ensure that it selects the correct subset of servers from
the TopologyDescription. Each YAML file contains a key for these stages of server selection:

- ``suitable_servers``: the set of servers in topology_description that are suitable, as
  per the Server Selection spec, given operation and read_preference
- ``in_latency_window``: the set of suitable_servers that fall within the latency window

Drivers implementing server selection MUST test that their implementation
correctly returns the set of servers in ``in_latency_window``. Drivers SHOULD also test
against ``suitable_servers`` if possible.

Selection Within Latency Window YAML Tests
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

These tests verify that servers select servers from within the latency
window correctly. These tests MUST only be implemented by
multi-threaded or async drivers.

Each YAML file for these tests has the following format:

- ``topology_description``: the state of a mocked cluster

- ``mocked_topology_state``: array of objects containing the operationCounts for
  each server included in ``topology_description``. Each element will have all
  of the following fields:

  - ``address``: a unique address identifying this server

  - ``operation_count``: the ``operationCount`` for this server

- ``iterations``: the number of selections that should be run as part of this
   test

- ``outcome``: an object describing the expected outcome of the selections

  - ``tolerance``: the maximum difference between an observed frequency and an
    expected one

  - ``expected_frequencies``: a document whose keys are the server addresses
    from the ``in_window`` array and values are numbers in [0, 1] indicating the
    frequency at which the server should have been selected.

For each file, create a new TopologyDescription object initialized with the
values from ``topology_description`` and populate the operationCounts based on
the information provided in ``mocked_topology_state``. Then, repeatedly select a
server for a read operation using the mocked TopologyDescription and a "nearest"
ReadPreference ``iterations`` times. Once ``iterations`` selections have been
made, verify that each server was selected at a frequency within
``outcome.tolerance`` of the expected frequency contained in
``outcome.expected_frequencies`` for that server. If the expected frequency for
a given server is 1 or 0, then the observed frequency MUST be exactly equal to
the expected one.
